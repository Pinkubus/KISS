Compute refers to the processing power needed to run applications, manage data, and perform calculations. In the cloud, this power is available on-demand. You can access it remotely without owning or maintaining physical hardware. Essentially, compute in the cloud means creating virtual machines with a cloud provider to run applications and tasks over the internet. In the following lessons, you will gain a thorough understanding of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a powerful compute service from AWS, as you explore its flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and scalability.
